# IPL-Data-Analysis-using-Excel
Hi!This is Surbhi.
I have started my data analytics journey.
In this data analysis project, I have analyzed IPL data from 2008 to 2020 and have drawn some extremely useful insights and trends.
First,I collected IPL data from kaggle and winner list for different seasons in IPL from google.
Analysis using Excel Microsoft Excel(Pivot Tables, Pivot Chart, XLOOKUP,Slicers.)
I used pivot tables to quickly summarize and analyze large amounts of IPL data by different dimensions and metrics.
I created charts and graphs to visually represent the data and identify trends, patterns, and outliers.I used bar chart,column chart,doughnut chart,trendmaps 
etc to present my analysis.
I also applied conditional formatting to highlight trends in the data,and formulas like COUNT,SUM,SORT,TOP10,VLOOKUP etc.
Some insights which I have drawn:
-Number of matches won by teams on the basis of toss decision-bat/field first for different seasons.
-Percentage of winning on the basis of toss decision.
-Top 10 Venues with most matches and winning of those matches based on toss decision.
-Top 10 Players who won Player of Match in different IPL seasons.
-Trendmap showing different teams who won most number of seasons in IPL.

We can also analyze and answer more questions and can draw insights and trends.
